            <h1>THE SPACE</h1>
        <br>
            <p>
            Perched on a north-facing ridge, our grove overlooks the dramatic contours of a glacial basin.
            <br><br>
            This land, where two ancient bodies of ice once met, carries a deep, textured history—a raw, untamed landscape forged by ice, time, and the forces of nature.
            The Wanaka Basin, where Mount Barker rises gently from the valley floor, has been sculpted over millions of years through the slow carving of glaciers and the collision of tectonic plates. The land is a product of these natural forces—uplifting mountains, glacial retreat, wind, and water—that have left behind layers of silts, gravels, and schists, creating a rugged and mineral-rich environment.
            The natural contours of the basin provide shelter, protecting it from harsh winds, while the elevation and nearby lake create a microclimate distinct from the broader Otago region. New Zealand’s island geography amplifies the uniqueness of this place, where the freshness of the surrounding seas mixes with the raw intensity of the inland climate. 
            Winters bring hard frosts and clear, still nights. The land speaks with the crisp freshness of morning frost and the hush of early mist. Summers blaze dry and bright, warmth settling over the hills like silk. As the day fades, the landscape transitions, temperature shifting with the setting sun, cool air whispering to the rising stars above.       
            <br><br>
            Nestled within this ever-changing landscape, the grove is situated at 609 Mount Barker Road. North facing and high on the hill, the views are truly breathtaking. On established grounds, the magnificent five bedroom home with its turret and fairy tale surrounds sits atop of the boutique olive grove.
