            <h1>THE GROVE</h1>
            <p><br>
            Nestled in the breathtaking landscapes of Central Otago, New Zealand, our boutique olive grove flourishes in the lee of Mount Barker, where the land stretches wide and carries the freshness of the nearby Southern Alps.<br><br>

            Planted in the early 2000s by Mick and Prue Hollyer, this small yet vibrant grove of around 100 trees has grown into a diverse and characterful landscape. Surrounded by rugged hills, alpine vistas, and the natural beauty of Wanaka, the grove is home to a harmonious mix of Italian, Spanish, and French olive varieties—most notably Frantoio, Leccino, Picholine, and Nocellara. These varieties were chosen not only for their flavour profiles but for their ability to adapt and thrive in this unique environment.<br><br>

            Rooted in fertile soils shaped by centuries of natural forces, and nurtured with care using organic, spray- and pesticide-free practices, our olive trees grow slowly and steadily under nature’s guidance. The region’s cool, clean climate—marked by warm, dry summers and crisp, clear winters—creates ideal conditions for producing fruit of exceptional character and quality.<br><br>

            This pristine land, with its ever-changing colours, shifting light, and seasonal rhythms, breathes life into every drop of our olive oil. The result is a small-batch blend that is rich in flavour, pure in nature, and deeply infused with the essence of Mount Barker—a true reflection of the land from which it comes.
